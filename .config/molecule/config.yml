# Tripleo-validations uses a shared molecule configuration file to avoid
# repetition. That configuration file is located at the repository level
# ({REPO}/.config/molecule/config.yml) and defines all the default values for
# all the molecule.yml files across all the roles. By default, the role-addition
# process will produce an empty molecule.yml inheriting this config.yml file.
#
# Any key defined in the role molecule.yml file will override values from this
# config.yml file.
#
# IMPORTANT: if you want to override the default values set here in this file,
# you will have to redefine them completely in your molecule.yml (at the role
# level) and add your extra configuration!
#
# For instance, if you need to add an extra package in your CentOS 8 Stream
# container, you will have to add the entire "platforms" key into your
# molecule.yml file and add your package name in the pkg_extras key.
#
# No merge will happen between your molecule.yml and this config.yml
# files. That's why you will have to redefine them completely.

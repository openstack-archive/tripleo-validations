      description: >
        In Ceph Lumionus and newer the Placement Group overdose protection
        check (https://ceph.com/community/new-luminous-pg-overdose-protection)
        is executed by Ceph before a pool is created. If the check does not
        pass, then the pool is not created. When TripleO deploys Ceph it
        triggers ceph-ansible which creates the pools that OpenStack needs.
        This validation runs the same check that the overdose protection uses
        to determine if the user should update their CephPools, PG count, or
        number of OSD. Without this check a deployer may have to wait until
        after Ceph is running but before the pools are created to realize
        the deployment will fail.

        - pre-deployment

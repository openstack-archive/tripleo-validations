      description: |
        In Ceph Lumionus and newer the Placement Group overdose protection check
        (https://ceph.com/community/new-luminous-pg-overdose-protection) is
        executed by Ceph before a pool is created. If the check does not pass,
        then the pool is not created. When TripleO deploys Ceph it triggers
        ceph-ansible which creates the pools that OpenStack needs.  This
        validation runs the same check that the overdose protection uses to
        determine if the user should update their CephPools, PG count, or number
        of OSD. Without this check a deployer may have to wait until after Ceph
        is running but before the pools are created to realize the deployment
        will fail.

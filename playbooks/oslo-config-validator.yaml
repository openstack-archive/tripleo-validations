      name: Openstack services configuration validation
      description: |
          This role is intended to leverage the `oslo-config-validator` on each one
          of the configuration files found on a deployment. The goal is to quickly
          catch erroneous configurations.

          When called manually, it will also be possible to generate a report
          returning all the differences between the current configuration and the
          default configuration

      name: Nova Status Upgrade Check
      description: |
        Performs a release-specific readiness check before restarting services with
        new code. This command expects to have complete configuration and access to
        databases and services within a cell. For example, this check may query the
        Nova API database and one or more cell databases. It may also make requests
        to other services such as the Placement REST API via the Keystone service
        catalog

        The nova-status upgrade check command has three standard return codes:

        0 -> All upgrade readiness checks passed successfully and there is nothing to do.
        1 -> At least one check encountered an issue and requires further investigation. This is considered a warning but the upgrade may be OK.
        2 -> There was an upgrade status check failure that needs to be investigated. This should be considered something that stops an upgrade.

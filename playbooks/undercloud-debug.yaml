      name: Undercloud Services Debug Check
      description: |
        The undercloud's openstack services should _not_ have debug enabled.
        This will check if debug is enabled on undercloud services.
        If debug is enabled, the root filesystem can fill up quickly, and
        is not a good thing.
        This role needs to be run against an installed Undercloud.
        The tested services must use one of the specified configuration files
        to set their debug status.

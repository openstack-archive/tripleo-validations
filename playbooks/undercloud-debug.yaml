      name: Undercloud Services Debug Check
      description: |
        The undercloud's openstack services should _not_ have debug enabled.
        This will check if debug is enabled on undercloud services.
        If debug is enabled, the root filesystem can fill up quickly, and
        is not a good thing.
      groups:
        - pre-deployment
    debug_check: "True"
  roles:
    - undercloud_debug

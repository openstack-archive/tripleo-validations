      description: >
        The undercloud's events database can grow to a substantial
        size if event_time_to_live is set to a negative value (infinite limit).

        This validation checks event_time_to_live and fails if the variable is
        set to a negative value or if it has no custom setting
        (their value is -1 by default).

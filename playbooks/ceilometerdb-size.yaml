      name: Events Database Size Check (DEPRECATED)
      description: |
        The undercloud's events database can grow to a substantial
        size if event_time_to_live is set to a negative value (infinite limit).

        This validation checks event_time_to_live and fails if the variable is
        set to a negative value or if it has no custom setting
        (their value is -1 by default).

        WARNING! This validation is considered as deprecated since Train release
      groups:

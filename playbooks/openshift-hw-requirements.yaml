        Check if there are enough resources for an OpenShift deployment on top
        of Openstack
        deployment:
        - Is there a flavor that meets the minimum requirements for a test environment? (4GB RAM, 40GB disk)
        - Is there a flavor that meets the minimum requirements for a production environment? (16GB RAM, 40GB disk, 4 VCPUs)
        - Are images named centos or rhel available?
        - Are there sufficient compute resources available for a default setup? (1 Master node, 1 Infra node, 2 App nodes)

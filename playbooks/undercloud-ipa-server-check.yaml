      name: Verify that the IPA server has the right permissions and ACI
      description: |
        This validation is relevant for systems where TLS Everywhere is enabled.

        A new ACI is needed on the FreeIPA server to ensure that certificates with IP SANs can be
        issued. This ACI will be delivered by default from FreeIPA 4.8.5.

        In addition, a new permission is needed to add DNS zones for tripleo-ipa. This
        permission is an addition to the current permissions for the Nova Host Manager role.

        This validation confirms that the new permission and ACI are present.

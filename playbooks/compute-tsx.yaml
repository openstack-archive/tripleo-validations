      name: RHEL8.x kernel flag for Compute nodes validation
      description: |
        RHEL-8.3 kernel disabled the Intel TSX (Transactional
        Synchronization Extensions) feature by default as a preemptive
        security measure, but it breaks live migration from RHEL-7.9
        (or even RHEL-8.1 or RHEL-8.2) to RHEL-8.3.

        Operators are expected to explicitly define the TSX flag in
        their KernelArgs for the compute role to prevent live-migration
        issues during the upgrade process.

        This also impacts upstream CentOS systems.

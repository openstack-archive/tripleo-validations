    name: Check if the NTP pool is reachable for the time synchronization
    description: |
      Time synchronization is essential for successful deployment. The chrony
      daemon is used for connection with the NTP pool for receiving time data,
      if the connection is unsuccessful the deployment fails. This validation
      is recommended to run if the deployment is failing on time synchronization
      task. This validation prints NTP servers chrony is trying to access.

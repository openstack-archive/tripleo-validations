      name: Check the number of OpenStack processes on undercloud
      description: |
        The default settings for OpenStack is to run one process (heat-engine,
        keystone, etc.) per CPU core. On a machine with a lot of cores this is
        both unnecessary and can consume a significant amount of RAM, leading
        to crashes due to OOMKiller.

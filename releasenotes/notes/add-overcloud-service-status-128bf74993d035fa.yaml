    Introducing the overcloud_service_status role. This role will hit the
    overcloud API for nova and cinder, retrieve the services and will trig a
    failure if one of these services are either down or deprecated.
    The original intent was to validate that nova-consoleauth was deleted after
    an update to RHOSP16.

        These are merely raw strings, that it asserts are passed to the `generic_ini_style_conf_parser`.
        From the pov of the test it is irrelevant what form they have.
        It's the `generic_ini_style_conf_parser` function that is supposed to receive these strings as arguments.
        Test is merely checking that the code immediately preceding it's call does what it should do.
        The regexes are finally used for parsing haproxy.cfg, which has a rather vague syntax.
        In short: The regexes are supposed to match all possibilities described here, and some more:

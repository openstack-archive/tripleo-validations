  name: Verify heat-manage purge_deleted is enabled in crontab
  description: >
    Without a purge_deleted crontab enabled, the
    heat database can grow very large.  This validation checks that
    the purge_deleted crontab has been set up.
    This role should only be used on systems using 'heat_api_cron'.
    Starting from Wallaby, the 'heat_api_cron' is no longer installed by
    default, and the role may behave upredictably.

  name: Nova Status Upgrade Check
  description: >
    Performs a release-specific readiness check before restarting services with
    new code. This command expects to have complete configuration and access to
    databases and services within a cell. For example, this check may query the
    Nova API database and one or more cell databases. It may also make requests
    to other services such as the Placement REST API via the Keystone service
    catalog

    The nova-status upgrade check command has three standard return codes:

    0 -> All upgrade readiness checks passed successfully and there is nothing to do.
    1 -> At least one check encountered an issue and requires further investigation.
          This is considered a warning but the upgrade may be OK.
    2 -> There was an upgrade status check failure that needs to be investigated.
          This should be considered something that stops an upgrade.

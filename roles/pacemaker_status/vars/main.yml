  name: Check the status of the pacemaker cluster
  description: >
    This runs `pcs status` and checks for any failed actions.

    A failed status post-deployment indicates something is not configured
    correctly. This should also be run before upgrade as the process will
    likely fail with a cluster that's not completely healthy.

    This validation fails if pacemaker service is found failed or inactive.

    - post-deployment
